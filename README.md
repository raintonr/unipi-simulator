# unipi-simulator

A simple node.js WS server to simulate the UniPi evok API.

This is *very*, *very* simple. I only really created it to play with potential WS based control systems.

How to run it
=============

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then access this URL with your Evok client:

http://localhost:3030/ws
